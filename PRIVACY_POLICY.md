Welcome to the Hotels near me app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Francisco Miranda. The app is available at Google Play.

I take privacy very seriously. My app does not collect any information. All data created is used by the app only. The app does not stored 
any data. When the app is off the data is lost.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any questions regarding 
how the app protects your privacy, please send me an email and I will fix it.

Yours sincerely,

Francisco Miranda
