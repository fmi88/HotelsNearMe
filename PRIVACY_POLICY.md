Welcome to  Hotels near me app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Francisco Miranda. The app is available at Google Play.

I take privacy very seriously. My app does not collect any information. All data created is used by the app only. The app does not store
any data. When the app is off the data is lost.   The user can make phone calls but user data is not transmitted off device.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any questions regarding 
how the app protects your privacy, please send me an email and I will fix it.

Yours sincerely,

Francisco Miranda
